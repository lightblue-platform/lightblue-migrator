lightblue-migrator
==================

###core
This includes classes and configurations to manage feature flags for migrating data between one lightblue entity and another.  Much of this is a wrapper around Togglz functionality, with lightblue migration-specific features. See [How to configure togglz for migration to lightblue?](TOGGLZ.md).

See http://slideshare.net/derek63/lightblue-migration for more information on how to do a lightblue migration.

###web
This is a web application for managing the lightblue migration feature flags, and it pretty much the stock Togglz web application.

###consistency-checker
The consistency checker builds as a self-contained jar using the Maven Shade plugin, and can be initiated from the command line using arguments.  An example of how to launch this batch application is included below. 

```shell
java -jar consistency-checker-1.0.0-alldeps.jar 
--name checker_0
--host lightblue.io
--config=lightblue-client.properties
--configversion=1.0.0
--jobversion=1.0.0
--sourceconfig=source-lightblue-client.properties
--destinationconfig=destination-lightblue-client.properties
```
